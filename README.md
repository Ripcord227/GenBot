# GenBot
This is a simple gen-bot made with discord.js. This works with discordjs v12. It uses a command handler making it is easier to edit parts of the bot. This only uses one package which is discord.js!

# Using the bot
Go through the entire bots code before using it. It is  very easy to use it. Just read up all the things given. Here are a few things you should keep in mind while going through the code:

- Change Server ID. You can keep the bot private only the bot owner can invite it or just add your server ID in all the commands. The commands will only be usable in that server
- Change channel ID. The commands can be only used in the given channel
- Change Emojis and Reactions. This may cause errors to you bot and hence I recomend you to change it
- Change thumbnails. Add a picture link in the place of any thing else given inside ``.setThumbnail("HERE ADD YOUR LINK")``.

# Starting the bot
**YOU NEED A DISCORD TOKEN TO START THE BOT. YOU HAVE TO PLACE THE DISCORD TOKEN IN AN ``.env`` FILE. Rename ``.env.example`` TO ``.env``. PLACE YOUR TOKEN IN THE SPACE PROVIDED WITHOUT ANY QUOTES**
## Requirements!
- [Discord.js V12](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
- [Discord Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
> If this is your first time ever making a discord.js bot I highly recomend you to watch a video on how to set up a discord.js. Also view up the [Discord.JS Guide](https://discordjs.guide/) and [Discord.js Docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome).

<br>**DO NOT OVER KEEP YOUR DISCORD TOKEN OR API KEYS PUBLIC!**
If your Discord token is public people may use your bot to do whatever they want. From massbanning members, deleting channels, etc. Your can regenerate your token if you ever think that it has been leaked out in the public. Then change the old token in the ``.env`` file with the new token!

# Other
- For Server ID's, Channel ID's you need to turn on Developer Mode. If you don't know how to turn out Google It
- For Emoji ID's > type ``\:EMOJI:`` which gives you ``<EMOJI_NAME:EMOJI_ID>`` as the result. The animated emoji id's can be obtained in the same way howeve, the result will be ``<a:EMOJI_NAME:EMOJI_ID>``
